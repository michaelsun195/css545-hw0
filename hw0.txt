1. We have not yet decided on a platform for our final project; however, we are leaning toward iOS because all of us regularly use iOS devices and would prefer to develop an app with iOS functionality. (In addition, from personal experience Android Studio is quite clunky so I would like to try developing an app using a different platform.)
2. We plan on using Javascript with React Native to develop our app, as it does not have the platform limitations of Swift development and we are all willing to spend some time to refresh our knowledge of JS. 
3. We will explore cross platform development if time permits (especially since React Native works well with cross platform development). However, the app's primary functionality will be our top priority and we will ignore this aspect if there isn't enough time.
